# Mercury

Mercury is a configurable open-source software-defined modem: (https://github.com/Rhizomatica/mercury).

# System Components and Configuration

The mercury software-defined modem is composed of two main layers, the physical layer, and the data link layer.

The physical layer is the part responsible for data protection via the use of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and information mapping on the electromagnetic spectrum via modulation using Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and other digital signal processing methods.

The physical layer provides a connection-less transmission. In other words, the transmitter doesn't have any information regarding the receiver status, the channel status, or packets received/lost. This task is left to the data link layer.

 The physical layer can be interfaced from the upper end and the lower end.  The lower end interfaces with the hardware via the sound card using the Alsa driver. The speaker and microphone can be connected to an off-the-shelf radio transceiver to transmit the signal over an electromagnetic channel.

The upper and the physical layer interface with the datalink layer via three main connection points, send(), receive(), and load_configuration(). In addition, function load_config(SNR) allows the physical layer to inform the data link layer of the appropriate configuration for a specific Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

ARQ

The data link can be in one of two roles, a commander or a responder. The commander is the side responsible for controlling the message flux.
The data link layer provides a connection based using automatic repeat requests (ARQ) via retransmission and acknowledgment mechanisms. This is to guarantee the reception of the information even in cases of message loss. In the case of an ack message lost, a request to resend the last ack message can be sent.

The data link layer packs the messages in batches to avoid a fast TX/RX switch. Nevertheless, the batch size is configurable and can be set to one. Several batches form a block. Writing to the TX data buffer and reading from the RX data buffer are done in blocks. The block size is configurable as well.

Gearshift

The data link later exchanges channel state information to negotiate the highest data rate possible for the downlink channel, and in case of a change, adapt to the new channel condition. This "Gearshift" is done via a set_config command that a commander can send at any time and a recovery mechanism in case of a worsening channel condition. The channel evaluation and gearshift operations are done at the beginning of each data block.

The data link layer connects to a possible application layer via two TCP/IP connections, a data dump buffer, and a control connection with an application-level interface (API).

API

A base API was implemented to provide the basic functionality in a way that would be familiar to users of commercially available modems.
The API can easily be updated and new commands can be added to provide further control to the application layer.

The base API is composed of the following commands:

1. MYCALL mycall\r

Sets the AQR call sign to the value of the string "my_call".

Reply: OK

2. LISTEN ON\r

Sets the ARQ to a responder role and waits for an incoming connection.

Reply: OK

3. CONNECT my_call destination_call\r

Sets the ARQ to a commander role and initiates the connection sequence to "destination_call".

Reply: OK

4. DISCONNECT\r

Terminates the current connection.

Reply: OK

5. BW2300\r

Sets the bandwidth to 2300 Hz.

Reply: OK

6. BW2500\r

Sets the bandwidth to 2500 Hz.

Reply: OK

7. BUFFER TX\r

Reads the number of data bytes in the TX buffer yet to be sent.

Reply: BUFFER bytes

In the case of an unrecognized command, a reply: NOK is provided.



The physical layer features an OFDM modulator/demodulator with an LDPC error correction code encoder/decoder with an embedded Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel simulator.
